# Cascade-I18n: Epics

This document breaks down the major features into Epics. Each Epic is a collection of user stories that, when completed, will deliver a significant piece of functionality.

## Epic 1: Core I18n Engine

**Goal:** Build a robust, performant, and framework-agnostic i18n service that supports contextual translations.

-   **User Stories:**
    -   **US-04:** As a Developer, I want to be able to define different translations for the same key based on user persona so that I can provide a more personalized user experience.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Design and implement the `manifest.json` structure.
            -   [ ] Implement dynamic module loading based on context (language, persona, mode, etc.).
            -   [ ] Implement the cascading merge logic for translations (`base -> userType -> persona -> mode`).
    -   **US-05:** As a Developer, I want the i18n service to be highly performant so that it doesn't slow down my application.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Implement in-memory caching for merged translation modules.
            -   [ ] Add benchmarks to measure performance.
            -   [ ] Optimize the deep-merge algorithm.
    -   **US-06:** As a Developer, I want clear and comprehensive documentation so that I can understand how to use the platform effectively.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods in the core service.
            -   [ ] Write a "Getting Started" guide for the core package.

## Epic 2: React SDK

**Goal:** Provide a seamless, idiomatic integration experience for React developers.

-   **User Stories:**
    -   **US-01:** As a Developer, I want to be able to install a single SDK package to add i18n to my React application so that I can get started quickly.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Create the `@cascade-i18n/react` package.
            -   [ ] Create the `I18nProvider` component to initialize the core service.
            -   [ ] Create the `useI18nContext` hook to access the i18n state.
            -   [ ] Create the `TranslatedText` component for easy rendering of translations.
            -   [ ] Publish the package to npm.

## Epic 3: Developer CLI

**Goal:** Empower developers with powerful command-line tools to streamline their i18n workflow.

-   **User Stories:**
    -   **US-02:** As a Developer, I want to use a CLI to initialize and configure my i18n project so that I can automate my workflow.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Set up the `cli` app with a command-line framework (e.g., Commander.js).
            -   [ ] Implement the `i18n init` command.
            -   [ ] Implement the `i18n sync` command to fetch translations from the API.
    -   **US-03:** As a Developer, I want to generate TypeScript types from my translation keys so that I can avoid typos and get autocompletion in my IDE.
        -   **Tasks:**
            -   [ ] Implement the `i18n gen-types` command.
            -   [ ] The command should read all translation files and generate a corresponding TypeScript type definition file.
